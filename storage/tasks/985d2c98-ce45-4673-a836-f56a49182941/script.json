    "script": "Studying material:  Yes, studying material processes solutions! It’s like light rays bouncing off surfaces and sound waves reflecting from the ears—this reality unfolds seamlessly!  For instance, physics principles like Newton’s laws often underpin problem-solving techniques in your studies. Recognize how forces balance determine object motions, or how energy transformations solve kinetic vs. potential challenges—everything is practical yet rooted in real-world phenomena!  So know this: while you focus on applications, the sheer act of learning material itself becomes something tangible and concrete in your reality. It’s as if you're solving life’s mysteries with every lesson, knowing it all plays into how solutions find their way.",
